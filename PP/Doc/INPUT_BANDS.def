    intro {
	Purpose of bands.x:
	    Rewrite the bands ordering them using the overlap 
	    of the wave-functions on neighbor k points
	    and calculate properties of each eigen-function.

	Presently it can calculate:

	   (a) The expectation value of the spin operator on each spinor
               wave-function.
           (b) The symmetry properties of each wavefunction. With this option
               the bands are not ordered according to the overlap.

        The input data of this program are read from standard input
        or from a file and have the following format:
