     the Fermi energy is    -2.1806 ev

!    total energy              =  -233.56515587 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =  -233.56515634 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <     0.00000092 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =  -393.52057327 Ry
     hartree contribution      =   218.31976501 Ry
     xc contribution           =   -41.80776429 Ry
     ewald contribution        =   -16.52166303 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =    -0.03492029 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  22 iterations
