TEST-SUITE  v6.1
------------------

Type 'make' for the list of possible options. Currently only PW, CP and EPW
are supported.

'make compare' compare the latest run of tests (SERIAL or PARALLEl) and 
redirect the output to a file called "out.XXX.`date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S`" 
'XXX' is replaced by the name of the package ('PW', 'CP', 'EPW')

Clean all test files and leave only benchmark reference via 'make clean'
command



REFERENCE OUTPUTS
-----------------

All reference outputs have been computed using GCC 4.8.5

The following configure options have been used:

./configure --enable-openmp --disable-parallel --with-netlib

DFLAGS         = -D__OPENMP -D__GFORTRAN -D__STD_F95 -D__FFTW
CFLAGS         = -O3 $(DFLAGS) $(IFLAGS)
F90FLAGS       = $(FFLAGS) -x f95-cpp-input -fopenmp
FFLAGS         = -O3 -g -fopenmp
FFLAGS_NOOPT   = -O0 -g
LD             = gfortran
LDFLAGS        = -g -pthread -fopenmp


During execution:

OMP_NUM_THREADS = 4
