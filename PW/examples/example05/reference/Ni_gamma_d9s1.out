!    total energy              =     -85.54366452 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -85.54365924 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          2.4E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -86.77835900 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      51.54364869 Ry
     xc contribution           =     -30.04254364 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -20.26641057 Ry

     total magnetization       =     2.00 Bohr mag/cell
     absolute magnetization    =     2.00 Bohr mag/cell

     convergence has been achieved in  16 iterations
