     Program PWSCF     v.4.1CVS starts ...
     Today is  6Mar2009 at 23: 3:16 

     !!! EXPERIMENTAL VERSION WITH EXX STUFF  !!!
     !!! DO NOT USE IT FOR ANY PRODUCTION RUN !!!

     For Norm-Conserving or Ultrasoft (Vanderbilt) Pseudopotentials or PAW

     Current dimensions of program pwscf are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     !!! XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = PBE0 (6484)
     !!! Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     !!! Please, verify this is what you really want !
