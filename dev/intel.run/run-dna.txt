Run script for Direct Node Access (DNA)

This run script might be a starting point for running Quantum Espresso (QE) on a set of nodes as enumerated by the "mynodes.sh" script. The run script as well as the "enable" and "mynodes.sh" files are expected to be located in QE's root directory.

General use and syntax:
./run-dna.sh /path/to/workload.in numnodes num-ranks-per-node | tee out.txt

Example for the AUSURF112 workload (single node of KNL with 68 cores):
./run-dna.sh /path/to/ausurf.in 1 68 -npool 2 -ntg 32 > asrf-cq68x1.txt

(The options "npool", "ndiag", and "ntg" are calculated inside of the script, but can be supplied as shown.
 One has to use thee verbose names rather than the short name in order for the script to work correctly.)

Typical customization points:
line #5-7
line #11
