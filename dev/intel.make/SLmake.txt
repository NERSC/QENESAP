Building NETLIB's ScaLAPACK
* Download from http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/#_scalapack_version_2_0_2
* Copy SLmake.inc into ScaLAPACK's root directory (scalapack-2.0.2)
* Edit line #32 and #33, adjust -xMIC-AVX512 as needed
* Invoke the build process: make -j
* Perhaps reinvoke the build process in a sequential fashion;
  there is an issue with building ScaLAPACK in parallel
* Check the ScaLAPACK library for corruption due to parallel build:
  nm libscalapack.a | grep pdpotrf
  The above should simply show the matched symbol rather than an error
  message about unknown object file formats
* Adjust QE's recipe, edit configure-qe-*:29:
  #export SCALAPACK_LIBS="${HOME}/scalapack-2.0.2/libscalapack.a" ->
  export SCALAPACK_LIBS="${HOME}/scalapack-2.0.2/libscalapack.a"
* Configure QE, and rebuild.
