Building NETLIB's ScaLAPACK
* Download from http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/#_scalapack_version_2_0_2
* Copy SLmake.inc into ScaLAPACK's root directory (scalapack-2.0.2)
* Edit TARGET=-xMIC-AVX512 as needed (e.g., use -xCORE-AVX2)
* Invoke the build process: make lib ("make scalapacklib" is not sufficient!)
* Perhaps avoid building in parallel (-j), or check the ScaLAPACK library
  for corruption due to parallel build: nm libscalapack.a | grep pdpotrf
  The above should simply show the matched symbol rather than any error
  message about an unknown object file format
* Adjust QE's recipe, edit configure-qe-*:29:
  #export SCALAPACK_LIBS="${HOME}/scalapack-2.0.2/libscalapack.a" ->
  export SCALAPACK_LIBS="${HOME}/scalapack-2.0.2/libscalapack.a"
* Configure QE, and rebuild.
