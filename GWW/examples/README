to run examples do

./run_example 

from the following directories: 

example01 computes the GW quasi-particle energies in CH4 (Methene molecule) 

example02 computes the GW quasi-particle energies in bulk Si (how to treat extended system)
             Note: in order to accelerate this example, used as a daily distribution test,
                     it is using parameters (a small 8-atom simulation cell whose Brillouin's zone 
                     is sample onlt at the Gamma point) giving quite unconverged results
example03  uses projwfc to plot GW DOS of CH4, example01 must be run before.
