Time Dependent Density Functional Perturbation Theory (TDDFPT)

Each example can be run separately by running "make" in its designated directory.

"make clean" resets the tests.

make.sys can be edited for parallel executions of tests by editing "RUNNER" variable (i.e. RUNNER=mpirun -np 4)

Examples: 

turbo_lanczos.x :

Benzene:  Benzene molecule, Tests the real_space and tqr implementations
CH4:      Tests Norm Conserving PP implementation
CH4-PR:   Tests charge response algorithm
SiH4:     Tests Ultrasoft PP implementation
CH4-BOND: This is an example that shows visual analysis of a softened bond in a set of degenerate bonds. 
CH4-ENVIRON: Example of using the Lanczos algorithm and the Environ module (implicit solvent)
tools:    Tools to compare data.

turbo_davidson.x :

CH4-DAV:  Example of using Davidson algorithm
CH4-DAV-ENVIRON: Example of using Davidson algorithm and the Environ module (implicit solvent)

turbo_eels.x :

EELS-Si-NCPP-LDA: Bulk silicon,  Norm-Conserving PP, LDA XC-functional
EELS-Al-NCPP-LDA: Bulk aluminum, Norm-Conserving PP, LDA XC-functional
EELS-Ag-USPP-GGA: Bulk silver,   Ultrasoft PP,       GGA XC-functional
EELS-Bi-NCPP-LDA-withSOC: Bulk bismuth, Norm-Conserving PP, LDA XC-functional, with spin-orbit coupling
